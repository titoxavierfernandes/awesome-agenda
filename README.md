The visuals illustrate the layout, event cards, header controls, and timelines across multiple device sizes. For a quick sense of the look, you can explore the provided demo app, which showcases:

- A calendar header with month navigation and today button
- A day view with a vertical timeline and event blocks
- A week view showing days in a row with stacked events
- A month view with compact day cells and quick event indicators
- A timeline view suitable for schedules and shifts

If you want to see live results, run the demo app in your environment or browse the prebuilt examples in the Releases assets.

---

## Getting started

This section walks you through installing and trying the component in a fresh React Native project. It covers both Expo and non-Expo setups to ensure the broadest compatibility.

Prerequisites:
- Node.js LTS (14.x or newer)
- npm or Yarn for package management
- React Native development environment (RN CLI) or Expo CLI
- TypeScript support in the project (the component is designed with TS types)

A note on environments:
- Expo provides a managed workflow that simplifies setup for most teams.
- RN CLI gives more control and can be better for complex native modules or custom native code.

The core idea is to get a working calendar on screen with minimal friction, then iterate to tailor features to your app.

---

## Installation

Install the package from npm and install its type definitions if needed:

- npm
  - npm install --save awesome-agenda
- Yarn
  - yarn add awesome-agenda

If you plan to use TypeScript, ensure your tsconfig includes the types for React Native and the component. The package ships with its own types, but you may want to tweak strictness or allow synthetic default imports depending on your project setup.

After installation, import the component in your screen file:

import { Agenda } from 'awesome-agenda';

Or, if you use a different export path, follow the exact export names from the library you installed.

You should then pass the required props for events and appearance. You can start with a minimal example and expand gradually.

## Quick start example (TypeScript)

This minimal example shows how to render a calendar with a few events. It uses a simple layout and defaults that work for many apps.

Code (TypeScript):

import React from 'react';
import { SafeAreaView, StyleSheet } from 'react-native';
import { Agenda } from 'awesome-agenda';

type EventItem = {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  start: string; // ISO date string
  end: string;   // ISO date string
  location?: string;
  color?: string;
};

const sampleEvents: EventItem[] = [
  {
    id: 'e1',
    title: 'Team Standup',
    start: '2025-08-28T09:00:00',
    end: '2025-08-28T09:30:00',
    location: 'Conference Room A',
    color: '#4F46E5',
  },
  {
    id: 'e2',
    title: 'Client Call',
    start: '2025-08-28T11:00:00',
    end: '2025-08-28T12:00:00',
    location: 'Zoom',
    color: '#F59E0B',
  },
  {
    id: 'e3',
    title: 'Lunch with Design Lead',
    start: '2025-08-28T12:30:00',
    end: '2025-08-28T13:30:00',
  },
];

const App = (): JSX.Element => {
  return (
    <SafeAreaView style={styles.container}>
      <Agenda
        events={sampleEvents}
        view="week"
        onEventPress={(e) => console.log('Event pressed:', e)}
        onNavigate={(date) => console.log('Navigated to:', date)}
      />
    </SafeAreaView>
  );
};

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
  },
});

export default App;

Notes:
- TypeScript types are used for events and props. You can customize the EventItem type to match your data model.
- The API includes callbacks for event selection and navigation, enabling you to drive app logic through user actions.

This quick start helps you confirm the calendar renders correctly. From here, you can tailor event rendering, handle complex data sources, and integrate with your appâ€™s navigation and state management.

## API Reference

The library exposes a set of components and utilities designed to be stable yet flexible. Below is a concise guide to the most important props and types. For exhaustive details, refer to the source types in the repository.

Event type
- id: string
- title: string
- start: string (ISO date)
- end: string (ISO date)
- location?: string
- color?: string
- data?: any (optional payload for custom rendering)

Agenda component props
- events: EventItem[]
- view?: 'day' | 'week' | 'month' | 'timeline'
- initialDate?: string (ISO date)
- onEventPress?: (event: EventItem) => void
- onNavigate?: (date: string) => void
- renderEvent?: (event: EventItem) => React.ReactNode
- theme?: ThemeObject
- locale?: string
- hour24?: boolean
- showNowIndicator?: boolean
- weekStartsOn?: 0 | 1
- showAdjacentDates?: boolean
- onDragEvent?: (dragEvent) => void (advanced)
- onRangeChange?: (range) => void

ThemeObject
- colors: { primary: string; background: string; surface: string; text: string; muted: string; }
- typography: { fontFamily?: string; fontSizeBase?: number; }
- spacing: { small: number; medium: number; large: number; }
- borderRadius?: number
- shadows?: { elevation?: number; shadowColor?: string; }

Custom renderers
- renderEvent?: (event: EventItem) => React.ReactNode
- renderHeader?: (props) => React.ReactNode

Accessibility
- aria-labels and accessible roles for events and navigation
- focus management on keyboard navigation where supported

Localization
- locale property to format dates and times
- ability to supply custom date/time formats

Animation
- optional transitions for view changes
- configurable duration and easing

Data handling
- accepts a flat array of events or a grouped data source
- supports event stacking and clustering

Development notes
- TypeScript types are exported for ease of use
- The API surface aims to be backward-compatible within major versions
- Internals are designed for future extension and plugin points

---

## Theming and customization

- Light, dark, and custom themes
- Override colors for brand alignment
- Change typography and spacing tokens to match your design system
- Customize event card styles, container paddings, and header layout
- Support for custom icons within the header and event blocks

To apply a custom theme, pass a theme object via the theme prop. The component reads tokens and applies them to all subcomponents.

---

## Localization and time zones

- Local time handling by default; events render using their ISO start and end times
- Locale-aware date and time formats
- Time zone support for cross-region apps
- You can provide a locale string to get consistent formatting across views

If your app needs precise cross-timezone scheduling, consider normalizing event times on the server or before feeding events into the calendar. The calendar will display times exactly as provided, and you can adjust with your own logic if needed.

---

## Accessibility and keyboard navigation

- All interactive parts expose accessible labels
- Focus ring and hit targets sized for touch and pointer devices
- In web builds, keyboard navigation is supported for focusable elements
- ARIA semantics are applied where appropriate for screen readers

Your app becomes more inclusive with these features. Keep the labels precise and readable for assistive technologies.

---

## Performance considerations

- Virtualized rendering for large event sets
- Batched state updates to avoid layout thrashing
- Lightweight event rendering with the option to supply a custom renderer
- Efficient date calculations and memoization to prevent unnecessary recomputations
- Debounced navigation to preserve responsiveness on slower devices

If you plan to load thousands of events, consider chunking data and using lazy loading strategies for additional optimization.

---

## Expo vs. React Native CLI

Expo
- Quick setup and streamlined development
- Good for MVPs and rapid prototyping
- Ships with a managed workflow and many prebuilt modules

React Native CLI
- Full control over native code
- Better for complex native integrations
- Suitable for large apps with custom native functionality

The component is designed to work well in both environments. For Expo, you can install and run the example project directly and test on your device or simulator.

---

## Demos and examples

The repository ships with a set of examples that demonstrate:

- Basic usage with a minimal event set
- Week view with multiple events and overlapping times
- Month view with compact day cells and event indicators
- Timeline view to support schedule-like data
- Custom event renderers and header layouts

Run the demo locally to explore all features. The demo is a practical way to understand how the component handles different data patterns and layouts.

---

## Advanced usage

- Custom event rendering: supply a React component to render events in your own style
- Drag-and-drop: enable drag interactions for reordering or rescheduling (advanced)
- Dynamic theming: switch themes at runtime by updating the theme prop
- Data adapters: write adapters to fetch events from API endpoints or local databases
- Local notifications: integrate with your notification system to remind users about upcoming events

Advanced users can tailor the component to fit complex scheduling requirements. Start with a minimal example and extend gradually to add features like recurrence handling and multi-day events.

---

## Data handling patterns

- Flat events array: simple and effective for most apps
- Grouped or nested structures: perfect for complex calendars with categories
- Recurring events: the provider can compute recurring instances based on rules
- Time-based clustering: events clustered by time blocks for efficient rendering

If you fetch events from an API, you can map them to the internal EventItem type before passing to the component. The mapping step helps ensure consistency across your app.

---

## Testing and quality assurance

- Unit tests for core logic, including date calculations and rendering decisions
- Snapshot tests for event rendering
- Visual regression checks for layout across device sizes
- End-to-end tests for user interactions, such as pressing events and navigating views

Set up your test suite to cover common workflows, then extend tests as your app evolves. The goal is to prevent regressions and ensure consistent behavior.

---

## Documentation and developer experience

- Clear API docs with types and example usage
- Rich, runnable examples that demonstrate real-world scenarios
- In-code comments and conventional naming to aid maintenance
- A well-structured repository with logical module boundaries

Documentation focuses on practical usage. It emphasizes how to get results quickly while also teaching deeper concepts for long-term projects.

## Best practices and design tips

- Start with a clean data model. A well-structured event object makes rendering simpler and more predictable.
- Keep views small and focused. Break complex layouts into reusable subcomponents.
- Use memoization for event renderers to improve performance on large calendars.
- Prefer declarative UI over imperative gestures wherever possible. It reduces bugs and improves maintainability.
- Test on multiple screen sizes and pixel densities to ensure a consistent look.
- Leverage theming to align with your app branding from day one.

These practices help you build robust calendar experiences that scale with your app.

---

## Troubleshooting guide

- Calendar not rendering: ensure required props are provided and the events array is in the expected shape
- Events not displaying in the correct time: verify ISO date formatting and time zone handling
- Theme not applying: confirm the theme prop is passed and that the tokens map to the correct UI parts
- Animations feel off on low-end devices: consider reducing animation duration or turning off complex transitions
- Expo build failures: check the exact error log and confirm plugin compatibility with the current Expo SDK

If you encounter issues, provide a minimal reproducible example. It helps the maintainers diagnose problems quickly.
